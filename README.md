# PixelVision² Updater Tool

###This tool was created by [< The master />](https://steamcommunity.com/id/themaster1004). I only update it here for faster download speed and a better overview. The original thread on the steam forums can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/pixelvision2/discussions/0/617329920700223960/)

>It's my pleasure to present to everyone our updated and improved PixelVision² Updater tool. It's a super simple auto-updater that downloads the latest version of the skin and extracts it for you. Credits to WittyAdrian for coding the program.

>We hope you'll enjoy using it as much as we've enjoyed PixelVision. Huge thanks to Pulseh for all his work, and Mr. late² for taking it over.

> We use our own custom web service to ensure you always have a download link available for redundancy in the event that one goes down.

Usage
> Our tool automatically finds your Steam directory for you, though you can change it. After verifying the path to your skins folder is correct, simply click "Download". Once the skin has been downloaded, click "Extract" to install the skin to the specified directory and you're done!
