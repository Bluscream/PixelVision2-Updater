# [PixelVision²](https://github.com/somini/Pixelvision2) Updater Tool

###### Please note that i'm not the creator of this tool. I only update it here for faster download speed and a better overview. See below for more info.

> It's my pleasure to present to everyone our updated and improved PixelVision² Updater tool. It's a super simple auto-updater that downloads the latest version of the skin and extracts it for you.

## Features
- Preserves your PixelVision² settings after updates
- Ability to edit skin settings straight from the tool
- Can restart Steam automatically after update
- Supports custom steam installations
- Supports legacy/original version of PixelVision
- Has an update feature for newer tool versions

## Download
[https://github.com/Bluscream/PixelVision2-Updater/releases/latest](https://github.com/Bluscream/PixelVision2-Updater/releases/latest)

## Usage
Our tool automatically finds your Steam directory for you, though you can change it. After verifying the path to your skins folder is correct, simply click "Download". Once the skin has been downloaded, click "Extract" to install the skin to the specified directory and you're done!

# Notes
> We use our own custom web service to ensure you always have a download link available for redundancy in the event that one goes down.
